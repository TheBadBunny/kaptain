# kaptain: GUI frontend for shell commands

A fork from http://kaptain.sourceforge.net/. Honours go to author Zsolt TÃ©rek.

> Kaptain is a universal graphical front-end for command line programs. It works on linux/UNIX platforms whereever Qt is available. Release 0.73 is using qmake and is compatible with Qt 4.
>
> Someone writes a simple script (so called grammar) which describes the possible arguments for a command line program and Kaptain brings up a friendly dialog to the user to set up the command line.

# Porting to QT5
Unfortunately, kaptain is no longer maintained. As it is based on QT4 and not ported to QT5, it already disappears from official repositories. It is a quite useful tool and I am not aware of another one that is able to provide its features. Personally, I am using it as a frontend for [x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker).

Is anyone out there who would like to port kaptain to QT5? :-)
